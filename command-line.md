# Command Line

## Open Directory in Finder

I feel dumb for having to write this one up, but all it takes is `open .` for the current directory.

## [Hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel)

### Adding a Rails project

When in the project folder, just do
```
hotel add 'rails server -p $PORT -b 127.0.0.1'
```
and you're all set!
